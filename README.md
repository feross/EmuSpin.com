Yeah, what can I say about this site? It was an inside joke that (sort of) unintentionally went viral.

If you’re curious, I built the site as a joke for Jake (my [Instant.fm](http://instant.fm) partner). Jake has long used [this emu picture](http://emuspin.com/img/emu.jpg) as his Facebook profile picture. And for some inexplicable reason the emu got rotated **90 degrees** at some point (either a bug in Facebook or he accidentally rotated it). After that, it became a running joke and **it’s been rotated several times since then**.

I rotated the emu once when Jake stepped away from his computer, and I can only assume that others have done the same. [EmuSpin.com](http://emuspin.com) is a tribute to Jake’s spinning emu.

## Emu ... Spin?

I didn’t think anyone but Jake would enjoy the site, since it’s an inside joke. **I suppose I should have known better**. An odd-looking animal spinning around for no reason = instant interweb lulz.

EmuSpin.com [made it to Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/hbw59/emu_spin/). (should’ve guessed it). Here are a few of my favorite comments:

> I was emused.

> Surprisingly difficult to turn away from.

> Anyone else expecting something profane to pop up at any moment?

> Stare at his beak for a long time then look away 

> I can’t get drunk and write a coherent paragraph; who does LSD and builds an entire website?

> A rival appears against [nyan.cat](http://nyan.cat)!

> BEST WEBSITE EVER.
